# ParkinsonsDisease_XGBoost
Parkinsonâ€™s disease is a progressive disorder of the central nervous system affecting movement and inducing tremors and stiffness. It has 5 stages to it and affects more than 1 million individuals every year in India. This is chronic and has no cure yet. It is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting dopamine-producing neurons in the brain.
In this project XGBoost Machine Learning algrorithm has been used to detect Parkinsons disease in individuals. XGBoost stands for eXtreme Gradient Boosting and is basesd on decision trees.
The dataset used can be found on UCI Machine Learing Repository. Link to file: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/parkinsons/
